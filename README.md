## Description

#### _This project is a recreation of the classic game "snake". In this project I utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this game but JavaScript is the main driver of this project. For example, all of the graphics are drawn on the screen using the html canvas tag which allows graphics to be drawn using JavaScript. In this project I also learned about JavaScript classes/objects and data-\* attribites to allow the control of element state styling in css._
